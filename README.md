# Super Sonic the Hedgehog 2
My Sonic 2 rom hack.

Created using the [Sonic Retro Github Disassembly](https://www.github.com/sonicretro/s2disasm/) which I forked in a weird way. :P

Be sure to read [Sharing.md](https://github.com/MineRobber9000/SuperSonicTheHedgehog2/blob/master/Sharing.md) if you plan on sharing (I has shortlinks!)
